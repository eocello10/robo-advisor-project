#For each stock symbol: its latest closing price, its recent high price, and its recent low price, calculated according to the instructions below, and formatted as currency with a dollar sign and two decimal places with a thousands separator as applicable (e.g. "Recent High: $1,234.56", etc.) - Complete
#A recommendation as to whether or not the client should buy the stock (see guidance below), and optionally what quantity to purchase. The nature of the recommendation for each symbol can be binary (e.g. "Buy" or "No Buy"), qualitative (e.g. a "Low", "Medium", or "High" level of confidence), or quantitative (i.e. some numeric rating scale).
#A recommendation explanation, describing in a human-friendly way the reason why the program produced the recommendation it did (e.g. "because the stock's latest closing price exceeds threshold XYZ, etc...")
